# CryptoClustering
The repositopry includes a resources folder with the cryptocurrencies dataset and a julyter notebook file that includes the code and the analysis.
The code includes the analysis of cryptocurrencies price behaviour, and specifically predicts if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.
Most of the code was developped based on the activities reviewed in class during the bootcamp sport. I have also checked some details of the code with copilot.
